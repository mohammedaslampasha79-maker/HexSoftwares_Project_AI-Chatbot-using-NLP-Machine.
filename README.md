AI CHATBOT DEVELOPMENT

# objective

The objective of this project is to create an interactive AI-based chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide basic support, and engage users in conversation. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to understand user input and respond in a human-like manner.

This Python program allows users to interact with a chatbot through a command-line interface. The chatbot is designed to simulate a simple customer support assistant capable of responding to common questions and greetings.

The chatbot application:

Accepts user text input

Processes input using NLP techniques

Predicts suitable responses using a trained ML model

Displays human-like replies

Allows continuous interaction until the user exits

# how to compile and run the program

Open a terminal / command prompt

Navigate to the project folder

Install required libraries (only once):

pip install nltk scikit-learn


# Run the program:

python main.py

# Important notes / assumptions

The program is written in Python 3.

It works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The chatbot runs in a terminal/command-line interface only (no GUI).

The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts for understanding user input.

A Naive Bayes Machine Learning model is used for response prediction.

All training questions and responses are stored in arrays inside the program.

The chatbot accepts user input continuously until the user types:

exit


Input is case-insensitive (e.g., “Hi” and “hi” are treated the same).

The chatbot can handle:

Greetings

Service-related questions

Help requests

Exit commands

If an unknown query is entered, the chatbot still attempts to generate the closest matching response.

The program does not use a database; all data is stored in memory.

The chatbot can be easily extended with more questions and responses.

Internet connection is not required after installing libraries.

The project demonstrates beginner-to-intermediate level AI and NLP concepts.
